My collection of MetaTrader 4 indicators. Written in MQL4, of course ;-)

## ValueCharts

![ValueCharts](/screenshots/ValueCharts.png?raw=true "ValueCharts")

No-fluff implementation. Can either work in signal mode where only the bars which are going above or below the signal line are highlighted or in non signal mode where it displays a traditional Japanese candle chart.

Supports Alert, Push, and Email notifications and plenty of customisable options.

## RSI-Bars-Notify

![RSI-Bars-Notify](/screenshots/RSI-Bars-Notify.png?raw=true "RSI-Bars-Notify")

The good ol' RSI, however it is displayed as a series of bars. Highlights the bars which are going above or below the signal line.

Supports Alert, Push, and Email notifications and plenty of customisable options.
